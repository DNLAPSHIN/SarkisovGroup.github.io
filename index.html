The mission of our group at the University of Manchester is to contribute to the development of the efficient technologies and devices for carbon capture, water purification, 
and energy harvesting from waste heat. We achieve this by developing the fundamental understanding of the processes on a molecular level, through the 
integration of this knowledge in the process design and material development, and through the development of new computational methods and algorithms.
