The mission of our group is to accelerate the deployment of efficient technologies for <b> carbon capture, water purification, 
en, energy from waste heat and separatins </b>. 

<hr>
  
We achieve this by developing the fundamental understanding of the processes on a molecular level, through the 
integration of this knowledge in the process design and material development, and through the development of new computational methods and algorithms.
